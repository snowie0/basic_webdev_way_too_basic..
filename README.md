# basic_webdev_way_too_basic..
this repository includes simple examples for basic html/css modules
it has some assignment related practices
and has 2 finished websites which includes all those modules learned from those they are called as "first webd" and the other one is "final_A".
I put all those work under 1 repository since neither I wanted to delete them nor they are important enough to be in seperate repos.
